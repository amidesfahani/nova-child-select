# Child select field for Laravel Nova

This field allows you to dynamically fill options of the select based on value in parent select field.

Works with Nova Tabs!

Field is based on [nova-ajax-select](https://github.com/dillingham/nova-ajax-select).
But instead of providing api endpoint, you can fill options by a closure function.
